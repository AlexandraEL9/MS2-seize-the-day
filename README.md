 ### Design

**Colour Scheme**

![Colour scheme](docs/colour-pallet.png)


- `#333`: Dark gray, primarily used for background in dark mode and for certain text elements.
- `#whitesmoke`: Light gray, used for background in light mode and for contrast with darker elements.
- `#darkslategrey`: Dark slate gray, employed for headers, outlines, and certain text elements.
- `#slategrey`: Slate gray, used for button borders and certain text elements.

The dark gray (#333) serves as the background in dark mode, providing a sleek and modern aesthetic, while light gray (#whitesmoke) is employed for the background in light mode, maintaining readability and contrast with darker elements.

Dark slate gray (#darkslategrey) is predominantly used for headers, outlines, and certain text elements, adding emphasis to important sections. Slate gray (#slategrey) is reserved for button borders and certain text elements, providing a subtle contrast against the darker background.

Contrast between text and background colors is carefully considered to ensure optimal legibility. Dark text on a light background is used for body text to maximize readability, while lighter text on a dark background is used for headings to create visual interest and hierarchy.

These colours are used across both dark and light modes to maintain a sense of continuity however the usage of them differs across the modes to get the required effect.

#### Typography
- The typography for Seize the Day prioritizes readability, clarity, with a modern aesthetic to enhance the user experience. 
1. Font Family: The primary font is sans-serif, providing a clean and contemporary look. This choice enhances readability, especially on digital screens. It is also a very standard font so will be legiable on all browser etc.
2. Font Weight: Various font weights are utilized throughout the design to create visual hierarchy and emphasis. For example, bold weights are used for headings (h1, h2, h3) to make them stand out and grab attention, while lighter weights are used for body text to maintain readability.
3. Consistency: Consistency in typography across the website ensures a cohesive and unified design. The same font family, weights, and sizes are used consistently throughout various sections of the website, contributing to a harmonious visual aesthetic.

#### Imagery
-   I chose not to include images to keep the design clean and focused on utility.

### Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes before starting the project to help me plan the layout and flow of the project.<br>
When I was creating my website, the design plan was changed but only small placement changes.

# A Word on Automated testing
- **Automated Testing**: Automated testing is the use of software tools and scripts to execute pre-defined test cases on a software application without manual intervention. It aims to verify that the application functions correctly and meets specified requirements. Automated testing can significantly speed up the testing process, improve accuracy by eliminating human error, and allow for more frequent and thorough testing, especially for repetitive tasks and regression tests. This approach is especially useful in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring that new code changes do not introduce defects.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site/ platform.<br>
**1a.** Solution: The website's landing page features a clear and concise tagline or mission statement that explains the main purpose of the platform: to help users manage their time and tasks efficiently. Additionally, the homepage includes a brief overview of key features such as the Pomodoro timer, to-do list, reminders, and dark mode toggle. This immediate clarity helps first-time visitors understand what the site offers.
<br>
![User Stories Main Page Top](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-main-page-top.png)


2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the platform and be able to interpret what I see clearly.<br>
**2a** Solution: The website uses a simple, intuitive layout with a top navigation bar and clearly defined section and a footer at the base. The use of icons and clear headings further aids navigation, making it easy for users to find and understand each feature. The design for inputs etc has been deliberatly chosen to be familiar with tools and functions used often ensuring ease of understanding and use.
![User Stories Main Page Whole](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-main-page-whole.png)

3. As a First Time Visitor, I would expect intuitive user interfaces, helpful tooltips, and possibly a guide to aid me in the use and usefulness of the key or unfamiliar functionalities.<br>
**3a** Solution: The user interface is designed to be intuitive, with interactive elements like buttons and input fields clearly marked.
A guide is provided for the function which may or ma5 not be familaiar to the user, (the pomodoro timer), explaining what the function is and how it can be beneficial to the user. It is a modal which is accessed via a button close to the heading.
![User Stories Main Page Whole](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-main-page-pomodoro-modal.png)

- #### Returning Visitor Goals
1. Efficient Task Management: Returning visitors would aim to efficiently manage their tasks using the platform's features. 
- - 1.1 They would want to quickly add, edit tasks to stay organized and productive.<br>
- - 1.2 They would want to set timers for focus and break times to stay productive.
- - 1.3 They may wish to set reminders for tasks which need to be done at a certain time eg. 4pm- attend Teams meeting.
- - 1.4 They may wish to change/ toggle the display of the site to suit either the room/time of day/ light they are in for medical or personal reasons<br>
**1a** Solution: Returning visitors can quickly manage their tasks through the streamlined to-do list feature. Tasks can be easily added, edited, marked as complete, or deleted. The interface is designed for quick access and minimal clicks, ensuring users can update their tasks efficiently.
![User Stories contact Page](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-contact.png)

**1a** Solution: The website fosters community engagement through an option to be put on a mailing list to be kept up to dat with upgrades, news etc.

### Further Testing
-   A large amount of repeated testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs/ issues
**Performance**
- Performance needs to be enhanced, especially load time, and investigation work done around images slowing page performance down without sacrificing image quality.

**Coding issues**
- I came across an issue while building the site. This issue was made evident when viewing the menu page in smaller screens. Some horizontal sections of the page had white, empty space on the right hand side.
- - In the first instance, I added "container-fluid" to the required sections. While this worked with some sections - the coloured background spread to fit the viewport - the section with the menu cards and images was still pushing out to the edges and creating white space. I looked deeper into the bootstrap code.

![Bootstrap card default](./docs/testing/bootstrap-card-default.png)

- - Firstly I removed any default dimensions and measurements relating to the card image so that I could control this in css. 
![Menu Card HTML](./docs/testing/menu-card-html.png) ![Menu Card CSS](./docs/testing/menu-card-css.png) 

- - I then used css to change the width to 100% so the image will not push out its container.

### Improvements/ scalability 
- Drive User Engagement: develop the site further and aim to encourage users to spend more time on the platform by offering more of a range engaging features such as interactive timers, customizable to-do lists, and helpful reminders. A range of backgrounds could also be provided making the UI more personal to users.
- Build more functionality for greater customization and personalization: Frequent users may value customization options that allow them to tailor the platform to their preferences. They might want to customize task categories, timer durations, reminder settings, and the overall layout to suit their workflow. This could also include extra functionality tracking healthy habits such as water drinking, portions of fruit and veg or active minutes.
- Tracking Progress: Returning/ frequent visitors may be interested in tracking their progress over time. They would use features such as task completion tracking and time logs to monitor their productivity and identify areas for improvement.
