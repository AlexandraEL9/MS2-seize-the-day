 ### Design

**Colour Scheme**

![Colour scheme](docs/colour-pallet.png)


- `#333`: Dark gray, primarily used for background in dark mode and for certain text elements.
- `#whitesmoke`: Light gray, used for background in light mode and for contrast with darker elements.
- `#darkslategrey`: Dark slate gray, employed for headers, outlines, and certain text elements.
- `#slategrey`: Slate gray, used for button borders and certain text elements.

The dark gray (#333) serves as the background in dark mode, providing a sleek and modern aesthetic, while light gray (#whitesmoke) is employed for the background in light mode, maintaining readability and contrast with darker elements.

Dark slate gray (#darkslategrey) is predominantly used for headers, outlines, and certain text elements, adding emphasis to important sections. Slate gray (#slategrey) is reserved for button borders and certain text elements, providing a subtle contrast against the darker background.

Contrast between text and background colors is carefully considered to ensure optimal legibility. Dark text on a light background is used for body text to maximize readability, while lighter text on a dark background is used for headings to create visual interest and hierarchy.

These colours are used across both dark and light modes to maintain a sense of continuity however the usage of them differs across the modes to get the required effect.

#### Typography
- The typography for Seize the Day prioritizes readability, clarity, with a modern aesthetic to enhance the user experience. 
1. Font Family: The primary font is sans-serif, providing a clean and contemporary look. This choice enhances readability, especially on digital screens. It is also a very standard font so will be legiable on all browser etc.
2. Font Weight: Various font weights are utilized throughout the design to create visual hierarchy and emphasis. For example, bold weights are used for headings (h1, h2, h3) to make them stand out and grab attention, while lighter weights are used for body text to maintain readability.
3. Consistency: Consistency in typography across the website ensures a cohesive and unified design. The same font family, weights, and sizes are used consistently throughout various sections of the website, contributing to a harmonious visual aesthetic.

#### Imagery
-   I chose not to include images to keep the design clean and focused on utility.

### Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes before starting the project to help me plan the layout and flow of the project.<br>
When I was creating my website, the design plan was changed but only small placement changes.

2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the platform and be able to interpret what I see clearly.<br>
**2a** Solution: The website uses a simple, intuitive layout with a top navigation bar and clearly defined section and a footer at the base. The use of icons and clear headings further aids navigation, making it easy for users to find and understand each feature. The design for inputs etc has been deliberatly chosen to be familiar with tools and functions used often ensuring ease of understanding and use.
![User Stories Main Page Whole](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-main-page-whole.png)

3. As a First Time Visitor, I would expect intuitive user interfaces, helpful tooltips, and possibly a guide to aid me in the use and usefulness of the key or unfamiliar functionalities.<br>
**3a** Solution: The user interface is designed to be intuitive, with interactive elements like buttons and input fields clearly marked.
A guide is provided for the function which may or ma5 not be familaiar to the user, (the pomodoro timer), explaining what the function is and how it can be beneficial to the user. It is a modal which is accessed via a button close to the heading.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals
1. Efficient Task Management: Returning visitors would aim to efficiently manage their tasks using the platform's features. 
- 1.1 They would want to quickly add, edit tasks to stay organized and productive.<br>
- - *Solution:* Returning visitors can quickly manage their tasks through the streamlined to-do list feature. Tasks can be easily added, edited, marked as complete, or deleted. The interface is designed for quick access and minimal clicks, ensuring users can update their tasks efficiently.<br>
![User Stories To-Do List](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-todo.png)
- 1.2 They would want to set timers for focus and break times to stay productive.
- - *Solution:* Users have the ability to use the Pomodoro timer feature to set focus sessions (Pomodoro, 25mins), short break sessions(5mins) or long break sessions (15min). The timer display will count down and at the end a 'calm alarm sounds and a modal displays telling the user to either focus for another 25mins or take a break.<br>

-  1.4 They may wish to change/ toggle the display of the site to suit either the room/time of day/ light they are in for medical or personal reasons<br>
- - *Solution:* Users have the ability to set the mode/colour scheme of the page with the use of a Dark Mode/ Light Mode toggler button in the footer. The display text on this button changes depending on the mode the page is in.<br>

- #### Frequent User Goals
1. Community Engagement: Frequent users might seek opportunities for community engagement, such as participating in forums, sharing productivity tips, or attending webinars or workshops hosted by the Seize the Day community.<br>
- - *Solution:* The website fosters community engagement through an option to be put on a mailing list to be kept up to date with upgrades, news etc. Through a 'Join Us' button in the navbar, a modal appears with a form to enter your email to sunscribe to the mailing list<br>
![User Stories To-Do List](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-join.png)

### Further Features
- **Error Page**: In the footer there is a link to 'www.seizetheday.com'. As this is simply a project and not a real site there is nowhere for it to go. as such, this links to an error page which opens in a new window.
![User Stories To-Do List](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-error-page.png)<br>
This page contains a message for the user and a 10sec countdown timer which then automatically sends the user back to the main page without intervention from the user through navigation controls/ buttons etc.


### Further Testing
-   A large amount of repeated testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

# A Word on Automated testing (TDD)
- **Automated Testing**: Automated testing is the use of software tools and scripts to execute pre-defined test cases on a software application without manual intervention. It aims to verify that the application functions correctly and meets specified requirements. Automated testing can significantly speed up the testing process, improve accuracy by eliminating human error, and allow for more frequent and thorough testing, especially for repetitive tasks.

For this project, I chhose not to use automated testing. My reasons for this are that, due to the complexity of the project and my own level of competence with javaScript, I had neither the bandwith nor the time due to deadlines and commitments. Were this project to continue developing, I would possibly use TDD in the following ways:
- **Possible Uses in this project**:
- *To-do list feature:* Test that a new item can be added. Test that an item can be marked as complete. Test that the list is cleared.
- *Timer feature:* Test that the timer starts when the button is clicked. Test the alarm is triggerd at the end of a timer.
- *Reminder feature:* Test that a new reminder can be added.
- *Subscription modal:* Test that the modal opens when the 'Join Us' button is clicked. 

Automated testing would have been handy, particularly as the development of this project went through many stages of development and changes often impacted other elements. Automated testing may have helped catch issues. There are also a number of timed elements which were onerous to check manually every time I logged in to check nothing had happened during development/ seemingly overnight.

### Known Bugs/ issues

**Coding issues**

- - *Reminder time input and accessibility:* I had repeated issues with accessibility in relation to the time input element in the reminder section.<br>
![Reminder section](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-reminder.png)<br>
Any label I tried to add wuld result in some catestrophic change ing the styling and alignment of the section. After some research on w3 schools and bootstrap, I found th 'sr-only' bootstrap class. This allowed me to add the labels but for 'screen-readers only' meaning the page has the needed accessibility without hampering the layout. <br>

  <img src="./docs/bugs-fixes/bugs-labels-2.png" alt="User Stories To-Do List Countdown" style="width: 45%;"/>
</div>
<br>

- - *Updating the time and date:* I had some learning to do with 'when' things update automatically. The header of the site has a date and time section which I wnated to automatically populate and update so the header is always up to date and correct.<br>
![Header section](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-main-page-top.png)<br>
 <br>
 The first iteration of the code looked like this:

 ![Header section](./docs/bugs-fixes/bugs-current-time-1.png)<br>
This was updating but not on the minute in line with actual 
time (it was updating every minuite from the page load), when checked with incidental/ in development testing.Research on https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-format-dates-in-javascript/ allowed me to isolate the 'checking' part of the code and I adapted to check every second.
![Header section](./docs/bugs-fixes/bugs-current-time-2.png)
<br>

- - *Button displays and changing/ 'toggling' the display- :* This refers to the 'Dark Mode/ Light Mode' button and the Pomodoro Timer's 'Start/ Pause' button. In the initial build, these displayed as they are above with both options on or- in the case of the Pomodoro timer- as two separate button. This made the buttons to large, not clear/ specific, or -in the case of the pomodoro timer- the use of two buttons made the interface busy and I want to keep the page as clean and clear as possible. <br>
Through research and a tutorial on 'scrimba', I found a way to change the display using 'text.content' which <br>
The basic code looked like this:
![Basic code from tutorial](./docs/bugs-fixes/bugs-button-display-1.png)<br>
 <br>
 I was able to adapt into my own code and add some if/else logic to to ensure the buttons showed the appropriate text at the time, with the adapted code looking like this:<br>
 <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="./docs/bugs-fixes/bugs-button-display-2.png" alt="User Stories To-Do List Countdown" style="width: 45%;"/>
  <img src="./docs/bugs-fixes/bugs-button-display-3.png" alt="User Stories To-Do List Countdown" style="width: 45%;"/>
</div>
<br>

### Improvements/ scalability 
- Drive User Engagement: develop the site further and aim to encourage users to spend more time on the platform by offering more of a range engaging features such as interactive timers, customizable to-do lists, and helpful reminders. A range of backgrounds could also be provided making the UI more personal to users.
- Build more functionality for greater customization and personalization: Frequent users may value customization options that allow them to tailor the platform to their preferences. They might want to customize task categories, timer durations, reminder settings, and the overall layout to suit their workflow. This could also include extra functionality tracking healthy habits such as water drinking, portions of fruit and veg or active minutes.
- Tracking Progress: Returning/ frequent visitors may be interested in tracking their progress over time. They would use features such as task completion tracking and time logs to monitor their productivity and identify areas for improvement.
