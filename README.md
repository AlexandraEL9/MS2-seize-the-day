## Planning

**Target Audience:**
People who wish to get out of the post-it/ write it on your hand trap! Keeping track of commitments is hard, particularly in this busy world. Seize the day is for anyone who wants a todo list, reminder tracker and timer in one. I'ts for anyone wishing to streamline their productivity and use their time more effectively.

**User Goals**
- Access the app with ease and resize to the required dimensions on desktop and mobile.
- Create to-do list items which can be added to, marked as completed and cleared in a simple and user friendly manner.
- Learn about the Pomodoro time blocking technique as a means to enhancing productivity and work/life balance.
- Use the Pomodoro timer as a means to block times of focus and ensure worklife balance with the introduction of breaks too.
- Set reminders for tasks which need to be completed at certain times of the day, for example, 'Attend tutor meeting- 4pm'.
- Exercise choice of display (dark/ light mode) for personal, or medical reasons.

**Site Owner Goals**
- Initially, I made this as a tool to help myself with my own organisation and productivity. It is a helpful tool.
- Increase User Productivity: The primary goal of the site is to help users manage their tasks and time effectively, ultimately increasing their productivity. This involves providing tools such as to-do lists, timers, and reminders.
- Enhance User Experience: to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate the application, add tasks, set timers, and receive reminders.

 ### Design

**Colour Scheme**

![Colour scheme](docs/colour-pallet.png)


- `#333`: Dark gray, primarily used for background in dark mode and for certain text elements.
- `#whitesmoke`: Light gray, used for background in light mode and for contrast with darker elements.
- `#darkslategrey`: Dark slate gray, employed for headers, outlines, and certain text elements.
- `#slategrey`: Slate gray, used for button borders and certain text elements.

The dark gray (#333) serves as the background in dark mode, providing a sleek and modern aesthetic, while light gray (#whitesmoke) is employed for the background in light mode, maintaining readability and contrast with darker elements.

Dark slate gray (#darkslategrey) is predominantly used for headers, outlines, and certain text elements, adding emphasis to important sections. Slate gray (#slategrey) is reserved for button borders and certain text elements, providing a subtle contrast against the darker background.

Contrast between text and background colors is carefully considered to ensure optimal legibility. Dark text on a light background is used for body text to maximize readability, while lighter text on a dark background is used for headings to create visual interest and hierarchy.

These colours are used across both dark and light modes to maintain a sense of continuity however the usage of them differs across the modes to get the required effect.

#### Typography
- The typography for Seize the Day prioritizes readability, clarity, with a modern aesthetic to enhance the user experience. 
1. Font Family: The primary font is sans-serif, providing a clean and contemporary look. This choice enhances readability, especially on digital screens. It is also a very standard font so will be legiable on all browser etc.
2. Font Weight: Various font weights are utilized throughout the design to create visual hierarchy and emphasis. For example, bold weights are used for headings (h1, h2, h3) to make them stand out and grab attention, while lighter weights are used for body text to maintain readability.
3. Consistency: Consistency in typography across the website ensures a cohesive and unified design. The same font family, weights, and sizes are used consistently throughout various sections of the website, contributing to a harmonious visual aesthetic.

#### Imagery
-   I chose not to include images to keep the design clean and focused on utility.

### Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes before starting the project to help me plan the layout and flow of the project.<br>
When I was creating my website, the design plan was changed but only small placement changes.

# Automated testing
- **Automated Testing**: Automated testing is the use of software tools and scripts to execute pre-defined test cases on a software application without manual intervention. It aims to verify that the application functions correctly and meets specified requirements. Automated testing can significantly speed up the testing process, improve accuracy by eliminating human error, and allow for more frequent and thorough testing, especially for repetitive tasks and regression tests. This approach is especially useful in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring that new code changes do not introduce defects.
- **Possible Uses in this project**:
- 
-

### Navigation bar links. 
Home, Gallery, Contact and Menus pages jump to the respective places when clicked. 
- These were tested a number of times. An issue arose when the site moved from the local browswe to published throu Girhub Pages. When this happend the links stopped working and an 'Error 404' page was shown. This was rectified by editing the filepaths to remove "/" at the beginning.
![Navbar Links](/docs/testing/navbar-links-matrix.png)

### Carousel Controls. 
Tested gallery controls checking carousel only moves on as a result of user input.
- The default of the Bootstrap carousel was that it would run automatically however I only wanted the image carousel to move as a result of user input. 
 ![Bootstarp carousel default](./docs/testing/carousel-controls-1.png)
- My first attempt was the change the 'data-ride="carousel"' to 'data-ride="none"'. However, this only changed the behaviour of the first slide, once past the first slide, the rest of the carousel ran automatically.
- After a deep dive into Bootstrap's documentation I added data-interval="false"' to the carousel div to disable the automatic cycling through the slides. 
![Bootstarp carousel fixed](./docs/testing/carousel-controls-2.png)


### Social media links open in the correct destination and in a new tab when clicked.

![Footer links](/docs/testing/footer-links.png)

- All links include 'target="_blank"' to ensure links open in a new tab.

![Footer Links Matrix](/docs/testing/footer-links-matrix.png)

### Contact Page Form. 
- Tested the form on the Contact page. All required fields worked and the submission button worked.
![Contact Form Matrix](/docs/testing/contact-form-matrix.png)

### Subscription Form.
- Tested the form on the Contact page. All required fields worked and the submission button worked.
![Subscription Form Matrix](/docs/testing/subscription-form-matrix.png) 


### Browser Testing.
- Tested with different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari(using my phone).

### Screensize and responsivity Testing.
- Tested with different screen sizes using the developer tool (Galaxy Fold, iPad, and my laptop)
    - - The site uses bootstrap across all pages to use a 1, 2, or 3 column layout. One column for small screen sizes, 2 columns for medium screen sizes and 3 columns for large screen sizes.<br>

**Homepage examples**

![Responsive homepage](./docs/responsive-homepage-2.png)

**Navbar examples**
- The site utilises a bootstrap component to collapse the navbar menu items into a toggle when viewing the site on small screens to keep the page neat and tidy.

![Responsive navbar](./docs/testing/responsive-navbar.png)
![Responsive navbar](./docs/testing/responsive-navbar-lg.png)

**Form examples**
- The site utilises media queries to organise form elements on the page in order ro manage space and content effectively. While the site as a whole uses a 3-2-1 bootstrap column design, I found that while this worked on small screens, it was not effective on medium to large screens as the half header half form weighting was not an effective use of space. After some reading I decided to add a media query to both the contact form and the subscription form. This media query and html changed the page make-up so that the header took up one third of the horixontal space while the form element took up two thirds. I also centered the header vertically to even out the use of space.

### Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

**HTML**

-   [W3C Markup Validator index.html](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-index.html-validator.png)
- - There were some 'Warnings' to do with header elements however these warnings do not take into account that the header for the content is in the previous section and the 'possible' misuse of an aria-label on my map. As these are warnings and not errors I ignored them.<br>

### Chrome's DevTools Audit Report

The Google Page-speed Services were used to assess the accessibiity of the project to ensure the site met expected accessible standards on desktop and mobile.

- In early development of the site, the site used two shades of green as opposed to blue. Through testing while coding, it became apparent that these colours did not work well from an accessibility standpoint as there was not enouth contrast. As part of the iterative process, I changed my scheme from green to blues which offered better contrast and accessibility.

-SEO score could be improved by adding a meta description tag to the head.<br>
-Page performance is an issue- possibly down to the large size of the main image on the site. Next steps would be to investigate reducing images without sacrificing quality.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site/ platform.<br>
**1a.** Solution: The website's landing page features a clear and concise tagline or mission statement that explains the main purpose of the platform: to help users manage their time and tasks efficiently. Additionally, the homepage includes a brief overview of key features such as the Pomodoro timer, to-do list, reminders, and dark mode toggle. This immediate clarity helps first-time visitors understand what the site offers.
<br>
![User Stories Homepage Top](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-homepage-top.png)
- The main basic information is put across first (who,what,where,when)<br>
![User Stories Homepage Middle](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-homepage-middle.png)


2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the platform and be able to interpret what I see clearly.<br>
**2a** Solution: The website uses a simple, intuitive layout with a top navigation bar that clearly labels each section (e.g., Home, To-Do List, Timer, Reminders, Community). Each section is also accessible from the homepage via prominent buttons or links. The use of icons and clear headings further aids navigation, making it easy for users to find and understand each feature. The design for inputs etc has been deliberatly chosen to be familiar with tools and functions used often ensuring ease of understanding and use.

3. As a First Time Visitor, I would expect intuitive user interfaces, helpful tooltips, and possibly a guide me in the use and usefulness of the key functionalities.<br>
**3a** Solution: The user interface is designed to be intuitive, with interactive elements like buttons and input fields clearly marked. A guide is provided for the function which may or ma not be familaiar to the user, (the pomodoro timer), explaining what the function is and how it can be beneficial to the user. It is a modal which is accessed via a button close to the heading

![User Stories Homepage Top](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-reviews.png)

- #### Returning Visitor Goals
1. Efficient Task Management: Returning visitors would aim to efficiently manage their tasks using the platform's features. They would want to quickly add, edit tasks to stay organized and productive.<br>
**1a** Solution: Returning visitors can quickly manage their tasks through the streamlined to-do list feature. Tasks can be easily added, edited, marked as complete, or deleted. The interface is designed for quick access and minimal clicks, ensuring users can update their tasks efficiently.
![User Stories contact Page](./docs/testing/user-stories/user-stories-contact.png)

- #### Frequent User Goals
1. Community Engagement: Frequent users might seek opportunities for community engagement, such as participating in forums, sharing productivity tips, or attending webinars or workshops hosted by the Seize the Day community.<br>
**1a** Solution: The website fosters community engagement through an option to be put on a mailing list to be kept up to dat with upgrades, news etc.

### Further Testing
-   A large amount of repeated testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs/ issues
**Performance**
- Performance needs to be enhanced, especially load time, and investigation work done around images slowing page performance down without sacrificing image quality.

**Coding issues**
- I came across an issue while building the site. This issue was made evident when viewing the menu page in smaller screens. Some horizontal sections of the page had white, empty space on the right hand side.
- - In the first instance, I added "container-fluid" to the required sections. While this worked with some sections - the coloured background spread to fit the viewport - the section with the menu cards and images was still pushing out to the edges and creating white space. I looked deeper into the bootstrap code.

![Bootstrap card default](./docs/testing/bootstrap-card-default.png)

- - Firstly I removed any default dimensions and measurements relating to the card image so that I could control this in css. 
![Menu Card HTML](./docs/testing/menu-card-html.png) ![Menu Card CSS](./docs/testing/menu-card-css.png) 

- - I then used css to change the width to 100% so the image will not push out its container.

### Improvements/ scalability 
- Drive User Engagement: develop the site further and aim to encourage users to spend more time on the platform by offering more of a range engaging features such as interactive timers, customizable to-do lists, and helpful reminders. A range of backgrounds could also be provided making the UI more personal to users.
- Build more functionality for greater customization and personalization: Frequent users may value customization options that allow them to tailor the platform to their preferences. They might want to customize task categories, timer durations, reminder settings, and the overall layout to suit their workflow. This could also include extra functionality tracking healthy habits such as water drinking, portions of fruit and veg or active minutes.
- Tracking Progress: Returning/ frequent visitors may be interested in tracking their progress over time. They would use features such as task completion tracking and time logs to monitor their productivity and identify areas for improvement.
